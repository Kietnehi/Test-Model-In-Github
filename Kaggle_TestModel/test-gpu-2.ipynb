I should mention that they're AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data.\n\nI need to explain their capabilities, like understanding and generating human-like text. Maybe include examples of tasks they can handle—text generation, translation, summarization, answering questions.\n\nAlso, it's important to touch on their training process. They use deep learning techniques, especially transformer architectures. Mention pre-training on diverse data and fine-tuning for specific tasks.\n\nI should highlight their applications in various fields: customer service, content creation, research, etc. But also note the challenges, like computational resources and potential biases.\n\nMake sure the introduction is concise but covers the key points. Avoid too much technical jargon since the user might not be an expert. Keep it clear and straightforward.\n</think>\ncontent: A **large language model (LLM)** is an advanced artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models use deep learning techniques, particularly **transformer architectures**, to process and predict sequences of words, enabling them to perform tasks like answering questions, writing stories, translating languages, summarizing text, and more. LLMs are pre-trained on diverse datasets, allowing them to grasp context, grammar, and even nuanced topics, and they can be fine-tuned for specific applications. They power tools like chatbots, virtual assistants, and content creation platforms, revolutionizing how humans interact with technology. However, their development also raises challenges related to computational costs, ethical considerations, and potential biases in training data.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig\n\n# 1.
