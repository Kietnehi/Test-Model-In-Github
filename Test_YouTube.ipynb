      "all these popular design patterns like workflow,   agents, retrieval augmented generation, and \n",
      "so on. Its minimalism is actually its power,   because it is so simple that an AI assistant \n",
      "like cursor AI can easily pick it up. So next I will show you how to set up pocket \n",
      "flow with cursor AI. We have already prepared   a Python template for you, which includes the file \n",

      "You can simply use this template or download   this template, and then upload it into your cursor \n",

      "file, which is essentially the documentation of   “Help me describe briefly about pocket flow,” \n",

      "start, but usually, you know, we don’t really want   to process the video and audio ourselves because \n",
      "YouTube should have already done that for us,   and also I don’t think text chunking is necessary, \n",
      "because the transcript is not that long and can   already fit well into the context of the current \n",
      "large language models. So let’s just say, “Hey,   help us simplify the utility functions. \n",
      "Don’t process audio. Just find a solution   to get the transcript directly, and \n",

      "generates a transcript given a YouTube link. Oh,   it also gives us a default YouTube link—let’s \n",
      "see what the video is for. Okay, we just got   rick rolled by cursor AI, which is pretty nice, \n",
      "but let’s see if the function works or not.   Unfortunately, it doesn’t work. There seem to be \n",
      "issues with this function, but let me figure out— All right, so I have fixed the issues for the \n",
      "YouTube transcription. It turns out that the   previous version was using pytube, which is a \n",
      "pretty old version that causes a lot of trouble,   so I just removed the dependency and just used \n",
      "the YouTube transcript API, and it works pretty   well. So we can check this out by just calling \n",
      "Python on the YouTube utilities functions,   and it successfully gets the title of “Never \n",

      "generate the HTML and save it together. So   the design of the workflow for the large model \n",

      "from the input YouTube video, it will extract   the transcript and different topics, generate the \n",
      "summary and the questions, and finally generate   and save the HTML code. This is a good starting \n",
      "point, but I think it misses a very important   design pattern called map–reduce. Here, the \n",
      "workflow generates a list of topics for us,   but each topic is kind of independent, and we’re \n",
      "going to generate a summary and a question–answer   for each of these topics. Instead of having one \n",
      "node that does the task for all the summary,   what we want is a map process that branches based \n",
      "on topics. We have one large language model call   Okay, so now let’s implement such a map–reduce \n",
      "design pattern by simply asking cursor AI to do   so. All right, in just a few minutes, we have \n",
      "cursor AI helping us update the design doc. So   we can take a look at the updated workflow: \n",
      "after we extract information from the video,   we’re going to have this map–reduce \n",
      "processing. It will first identify all   the interesting topics from the video, then it \n",
      "will process each individual topic one by one,   and finally reduce the results by aggregating \n",
      "the topics, questions, and answers. We can see   that for the processing node, we’re going to have \n",
      "a batch node—essentially, it’s not a single call;   it’s a batch of large model calls, one for \n",
      "each topic. Now, this design looks great. Let’s   finally go ahead and implement the design. The \n",
      "implementation is actually the easiest part,   because we can just simply ask cursor AI, \n",
      "“Help me implement based on the design.” In around 5 minutes, cursor has finished the \n",
      "implementation of the workflow. As you can see,   it starts by reading through the contextual \n",
      "file, then it populates the flow.py,   and here’s how flow.py looks. It essentially \n",
      "implements all the nodes described in the   design doc, starting from the input nodes, then \n",
      "extracting video information, and so on. Finally,   all these nodes are connected together into \n",
      "a workflow that is used to generate the final   YouTube summary. We can test this out by just \n",
      "going through main.py and providing the Lex   YouTube video as input. It extracts the YouTube \n",
      "information and generates interesting topics,   which will take a while because it’s quite a \n",
      "large transcript, but let’s wait a few minutes. So finally, in about 3 minutes, the script \n",
      "has finished, and we have the resulting   summary in this HTML page. We can render \n",
      "this HTML and see a nice visualization of   the YouTube title and thumbnail. We also have \n",
      "a kid-friendly summary of these YouTube videos,   some topics on AI models, open weights AI, and \n",
      "a few interesting questions under these topics   like what’s the AI reasoning part, what’s the \n",
      "political implication, and why companies need   electricity. There’s also a topic on hardware \n",
      "and megaclusters. We can see that this is a much,   much higher-quality summarization compared \n",
      "to the naive single-prompt approach. So this concludes this video tutorial. Hopefully, \n",

But when it comes to real problems in real code bases, these things just aren't that useful. And you don't understand why everybody's getting so hyped and excited about those things. If that's your perspective, I understand. There's a lot of reasons most people should feel that way, and I did myself just a few weeks ago. But the harsh reality is that things are changing, and I want to talk a bit about that. But more importantly, the mistakes that you might be making when you use these tools that result in the lackluster experience that you're having. This stuff has changed so much and my own understanding of how I use it has too.

      "Võ Văn Kiệt (born Phan Văn Hòa; 23 November 1922 – 11 June 2008) was a Vietnamese communist revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam from 1991 to 1997.\n",
      "[1]\n",
      "[2]\n",
      "Born into a sharecropper family in the southern Mekong Delta, he joined the anti-colonial movement against French rule at age 16 in 1938 and later participated as a Viet Cong guerrilla fighter opposing the American-backed South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War.\n",
      "[2]\n",
      "[3]\n",
      "Following the 1975 unification under communist control, Kiệt held key administrative roles in the South, including in Ho Chi Minh City, where firsthand experience with the failures of rigid collectivization informed his push for economic pragmatism within the Communist Party.\n",

      "(Renovation) policies launched at the 1986 Party Congress, which shifted Vietnam from a failing centrally planned system toward a socialist-oriented market economy emphasizing exports, private enterprise, and foreign investment while preserving one-party rule.\n",
      "[5]\n",
      "[6]\n",
      "These reforms, crediting Kiệt's strategic vision, catalyzed Vietnam's transition from subsistence agriculture to export-driven growth, averting economic collapse and enabling normalization of diplomatic ties, including eventual U.S. relations.\n",

      "[4]\n",
      "Kiệt's tenure as\n",
      "Prime Minister\n",
      "solidified these changes amid internal party resistance from ideological conservatives, prioritizing empirical outcomes like increased grain production and consumer goods over doctrinal purity, though political\n",
